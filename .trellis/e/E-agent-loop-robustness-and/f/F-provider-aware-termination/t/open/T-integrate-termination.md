# Integrate Termination Detection with AgentLoop

## Context

Update the existing AgentLoop multi-turn execution to use the new provider-aware termination detection instead of the simple boolean `isTerminal()` checks. This enables intelligent continuation decisions based on termination reasons and confidence levels. Delete `isTerminal()` and supporting code when complete.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Update AgentLoop Termination Logic

Modify `src/core/agent/agentLoop.ts` in existing multi-turn methods:

- Replace boolean termination checks with `UnifiedTerminationSignal` analysis
- Use termination reasons to make intelligent continuation decisions
- Integrate confidence levels into decision-making logic
- Preserve provider-specific metadata for debugging

### 2. Termination Decision Logic

Implement smart continuation logic:

```typescript
private shouldContinueBasedOnTermination(signal: UnifiedTerminationSignal): boolean {
  // NATURAL_COMPLETION with high confidence = definitely stop
  if (signal.reason === TerminationReason.NATURAL_COMPLETION && signal.confidence === "high") {
    return false;
  }

  // TOKEN_LIMIT_REACHED = stop but consider budget expansion
  if (signal.reason === TerminationReason.TOKEN_LIMIT_REACHED) {
    return false; // For now, will be enhanced with budget management later
  }

  // CONTENT_FILTERED = stop for safety
  if (signal.reason === TerminationReason.CONTENT_FILTERED) {
    return false;
  }

  // UNKNOWN with low confidence = continue with caution
  if (signal.reason === TerminationReason.UNKNOWN && signal.confidence === "low") {
    return true; // Provider might not be signaling properly
  }

  return false; // Default to stopping
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Termination Context

Update termination tracking to include:

- Provider-specific termination metadata
- Confidence levels for debugging
- Termination reason history across iterations
- Provider consistency analysis

### 4. Fallback for Legacy Providers

Ensure backward compatibility:

- Use existing `isTerminal()` for providers without `detectTermination()`
- Convert boolean results to `UnifiedTerminationSignal` using default helper
- Maintain consistent behavior for legacy integrations

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Smart Termination Decisions**

- High-confidence natural completion stops conversation
- Token limit termination stops with proper error context
- Content filtering stops with safety information
- Low-confidence unknown signals allow cautious continuation

✅ **Multi-Turn Integration**

- Works with existing `executeMultiTurn()` method
- Integrates with iteration management and timeout handling
- Preserves existing safety limits (max iterations, timeouts)
- Maintains backward compatibility with current behavior

✅ **Streaming Integration**

- Works with streaming responses during multi-turn execution
- Handles streaming interruption scenarios properly
- Coordinates with tool execution during streaming
- Maintains streaming state consistency

✅ **Provider Fallback**

- Gracefully handles providers without `detectTermination()`
- Uses default termination detection helper for legacy providers
- Maintains consistent behavior across provider types
- No breaking changes for existing provider implementations

✅ **Observability Integration**

- Emits termination events with detailed context
- Includes termination reason and confidence in logging
- Preserves provider-specific metadata for debugging
- Sanitizes sensitive information in observability data

## Implementation Approach

1. **Identify termination points**: Find all `isTerminal()` calls in AgentLoop
2. **Add helper methods**: Create private methods for termination analysis
3. **Update decision logic**: Replace boolean checks with reason-based decisions
4. **Add fallback handling**: Support providers without new detection method
5. **Enhance observability**: Add termination context to event emission

## Testing Requirements

Create comprehensive tests in `src/core/agent/__tests__/`:

- Termination decision logic for all TerminationReason values
- Confidence level impact on continuation decisions
- Backward compatibility with boolean `isTerminal()` results
- Integration with existing multi-turn test scenarios
- Streaming termination during multi-turn execution
- Provider fallback behavior for legacy implementations

## Integration Points

### Multi-Turn State

- Update `MultiTurnState` to include termination signal history
- Track termination confidence trends across iterations
- Preserve provider-specific termination metadata

### Iteration Manager

- Integrate termination analysis with iteration completion logic
- Use termination confidence for iteration timeout decisions
- Include termination context in execution metrics

### Streaming State Machine

- Coordinate termination detection with streaming interruption
- Handle termination signals during tool execution
- Maintain termination state across streaming pause/resume cycles

## Files to Modify

- `src/core/agent/agentLoop.ts` (enhance termination logic)
- `src/core/agent/multiTurnState.ts` (add termination signal tracking)
- `src/core/agent/__tests__/agentLoop.test.ts` (add termination tests)

## Integration Notes

- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing multi-turn functionality must continue working
- **Provider Agnostic**: Works consistently across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, xAI
- **Simple Logic**: Use straightforward decision rules, avoid over-engineering
- **Safety First**: Err on side of stopping rather than continuing when uncertain

## Out of Scope

- Token budget management integration (future enhancement)
- Complex termination policies or configuration
- Provider-specific termination customization
- Advanced termination prediction or learning
