# Implement streaming cancellation handler

## Context

Implement specialized cancellation handling for streaming responses to enable mid-stream interruption with proper buffer management and stream cleanup.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. StreamCancellationHandler Class

Create `src/core/agent/cancellation/streamCancellationHandler.ts`:

```typescript
interface StreamCancellationHandler {
  pauseStream(): Promise<void>;
  resumeStream(): Promise<void>;
  cancelStream(reason?: string): Promise<void>;
  getStreamState(): "active" | "paused" | "cancelled" | "completed";
  getCurrentBuffer(): string;
  clearBuffer(): void;
}

class StreamCancellationHandler implements StreamCancellationHandler {
  private streamState: StreamState = "active";
  private buffer: string = "";
  private cancellationManager: CancellationManager;

  // Stream lifecycle management
  // Buffer management during interruption
  // Provider stream cleanup coordination
}
```

### 2. Mid-Stream Cancellation Detection

- Monitor AbortSignal during async iteration over stream
- Detect cancellation within 100ms of signal
- Clean stream buffer management during cancellation
- Provider stream cleanup and connection termination

### 3. Stream State Management

- Track stream state transitions (active → paused → cancelled)
- Preserve partial response content for debugging
- Handle stream resumption after temporary interruption
- Coordinate with streaming interruption wrapper

### 4. Buffer Management

- Accumulate partial responses during stream processing
- Preserve buffer content when cancellation occurs
- Clear buffer appropriately after successful completion
- Provide access to partial content for error reporting

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ StreamCancellationHandler manages streaming state lifecycle
- ✅ Mid-stream cancellation detection within 100ms
- ✅ Clean stream buffer management during cancellation
- ✅ Provider stream cleanup and connection termination
- ✅ Partial response preservation for debugging

### Stream State Requirements

- ✅ State transitions: active → paused → cancelled/completed
- ✅ Resume capability after cancellation resolution (if applicable)
- ✅ Buffer content preservation during state transitions
- ✅ Clear state reporting for debugging and monitoring

### Performance Requirements

- ✅ Stream cancellation response within 200ms
- ✅ Buffer management without memory leaks
- ✅ Network cleanup without connection leaks
- ✅ Minimal impact on normal streaming performance

### Integration Requirements

- ✅ Integrates with existing StreamingInterruptionWrapper
- ✅ Coordinates with CancellationManager for unified cancellation
- ✅ Supports provider-specific stream handling patterns
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing streaming infrastructure

### Testing Requirements

- ✅ Unit tests for stream state management and transitions
- ✅ Mid-stream cancellation detection timing tests
- ✅ Buffer management and memory leak prevention tests
- ✅ Integration tests with StreamingInterruptionWrapper
- ✅ Provider stream cleanup validation tests

## File Structure

```
src/core/agent/cancellation/
├── streamCancellationHandler.ts
└── __tests__/
    └── streamCancellationHandler.test.ts
```

## Dependencies

- Requires AgentLoop cancellation integration (T-integrate-cancellation)
- Integrates with existing streaming infrastructure

## Out of Scope

- Provider-specific streaming implementation (existing)
- Tool execution during streaming (existing)
- General stream interruption logic (existing)
