# Integrate Streaming Interruption with BridgeClient.stream() Method

## Context

This task integrates streaming interruption capabilities into the existing `BridgeClient.stream()` method, enabling tool call detection and execution during streaming responses. This is essential for providing multi-turn capabilities in streaming scenarios.

## Related Files

- `src/client/bridgeClient.ts` - BridgeClient.stream() method (lines 342-400)
- `src/core/agent/streamingStateMachine.ts` - Streaming state machine (from previous task)
- `src/core/agent/agentLoop.ts` - Multi-turn orchestration integration

## Current Streaming Flow

Current `BridgeClient.stream()` method simply returns provider streaming response:

```typescript
// Parse response - must be AsyncIterable<StreamDelta>
return plugin.parseResponse(httpRes, true) as AsyncIterable<StreamDelta>;
```

**This needs to be wrapped with streaming interruption handling.**

## Implementation Requirements

Enhance the streaming flow to support tool call interruption:

1. **Wrap provider stream** with streaming interruption handler
2. **Detect tool calls** during streaming response processing
3. **Coordinate tool execution** while maintaining stream state
4. **Resume streaming** after tool execution completion
5. **Handle streaming errors** and partial responses gracefully

## Technical Approach

1. **Create streaming wrapper** that intercepts provider stream chunks
2. **Integrate with streaming state machine** for tool call detection
3. **Coordinate with multi-turn orchestration** for tool execution
4. **Provide unified streaming interface** that handles interruption transparently
5. **Maintain backward compatibility** for non-tool streaming requests

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Streaming Interruption Detection**

- Detects tool calls emitted during streaming responses
- Pauses streaming gracefully when tool calls are found
- Maintains stream buffer integrity during interruption
- Handles provider-specific streaming formats correctly

✅ **Tool Execution During Streaming**

- Executes detected tool calls while stream is paused
- Applies configured tool execution strategy (sequential/parallel)
- Maintains tool execution context and security
- Handles tool execution errors gracefully

✅ **Stream Resumption**

- Resumes streaming after tool execution completion
- Includes tool results in continued stream flow
- Maintains message ordering and conversation integrity
- Handles resumption failures with proper fallback

✅ **Provider Integration**

- Works with all registered provider plugins
- Handles provider-specific streaming response formats
- Maintains existing provider error handling patterns
- Preserves provider timeout and configuration handling

✅ **Backward Compatibility**

- Non-tool streaming requests work exactly as before
- Existing streaming API contracts preserved
- No breaking changes to StreamDelta interface
- Compatible with existing provider plugin implementations

## Testing Requirements

**Integration Tests** (include in this task):

- Streaming interruption with tool calls across different providers
- Stream resumption after tool execution completion
- Error handling during streaming interruption scenarios
- Backward compatibility with existing streaming usage patterns
- Performance characteristics of streaming interruption overhead

## Out of Scope

- Provider plugin modifications (separate tasks)
- Advanced streaming optimization (future enhancement)
- Cancellation during streaming (handled by cancellation feature)
- Complex streaming state management (already implemented in state machine)

## Dependencies

- T-integrate-streaming (streaming interruption with multi-turn orchestration)
- T-create-streaming-state (streaming state machine implementation)

## Security Considerations

- Validate tool calls detected during streaming
- Ensure stream buffer cleanup on errors
- Prevent injection through streaming data
- Maintain existing streaming security patterns

## Performance Requirements

- Streaming interruption detection overhead < 100ms per tool call
- Stream buffer management memory-efficient
- Tool execution coordination adds < 50ms latency
- Resumption overhead negligible for user experience

## Implementation Notes

- Design streaming wrapper as transparent layer over provider streams
- Ensure clean separation between streaming and tool execution concerns
- Provide comprehensive error context for streaming interruption failures
- Maintain existing streaming performance characteristics
