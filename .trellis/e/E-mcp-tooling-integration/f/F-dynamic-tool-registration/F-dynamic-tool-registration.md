# Dynamic Tool Registration System

## Purpose and Functionality

Extend the existing tool system to support dynamic registration and removal of MCP tools while maintaining all existing validation and registration guardrails. This feature integrates MCP tool discovery with the current `ToolRouter` and `InMemoryToolRegistry` system through the established `BridgeClient.initializeToolSystem` lifecycle.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Tool Registry Extensions

- Extend `InMemoryToolRegistry` to support dynamic tool addition and removal
- Add tool health status tracking for connection-dependent tools
- Implement configurable strategies for handling tool unavailability
- Maintain existing registry interface compatibility

### 2. Tool Router Integration

- Extend `ToolRouter` to handle dynamic tool discovery during initialization
- Add support for marking tools as unhealthy vs. immediate removal
- Integrate MCP tool execution with existing pipeline and validation
- Preserve all current tool execution guardrails

### 3. BridgeClient Lifecycle Integration

- Extend `BridgeClient.initializeToolSystem` to include MCP tool discovery
- Add MCP connection management to client lifecycle
- Implement proper cleanup on client disposal
- Maintain existing tool system initialization patterns

### 4. Tool Failure Strategy Implementation

- Implement configurable tool failure handling strategies
- Support immediate unregistration vs. marking tools unhealthy
- Provide clear error responses for unavailable tools
- Enable graceful degradation when MCP servers are down

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Tool Registry Dynamic Support

- [ ] `InMemoryToolRegistry` extended with `addTool` and `removeTool` methods
- [ ] Tool health status tracking with `healthy`, `unhealthy`, and `unavailable` states
- [ ] Dynamic tool addition preserves existing validation requirements
- [ ] Tool removal maintains registry consistency and thread safety
- [ ] Registry supports querying tool health status for monitoring

### Tool Router Dynamic Integration

- [ ] `ToolRouter` supports dynamic tool registration during runtime
- [ ] MCP tools integrate seamlessly with existing tool execution pipeline
- [ ] Tool discovery occurs during `BridgeClient.initializeToolSystem` phase
- [ ] Dynamic tools respect existing timeout and validation configurations
- [ ] Tool execution maintains existing error handling and logging patterns

### BridgeClient Integration

- [ ] `initializeToolSystem` extended to discover and register MCP tools
- [ ] MCP server connections established during client initialization
- [ ] Tool discovery completes before client initialization finishes
- [ ] Client disposal properly cleans up MCP connections and tools
- [ ] Initialization failures handle MCP errors gracefully without breaking client

### Tool Failure Strategy Implementation

- [ ] Configurable `mcpToolFailureStrategy` in tools configuration
- [ ] `"immediate_unregister"` strategy removes tools from registry on connection loss
- [ ] `"mark_unhealthy"` strategy keeps tools registered but returns errors on execution
- [ ] Default strategy is `"mark_unhealthy"` for graceful degradation
- [ ] Strategy configuration validated through existing schema validation

### Tool Health Management

- [ ] Tool health status updated automatically on connection events
- [ ] Unhealthy tools return clear error messages when executed
- [ ] Tool health monitoring detects server reconnection and updates status
- [ ] Health status changes logged through existing logging infrastructure
- [ ] Tool registry provides health status query interface

### Existing Guardrails Preservation

- [ ] All existing tool validation requirements preserved for MCP tools
- [ ] Tool definition schema validation applied to discovered MCP tools
- [ ] Execution context validation maintains security boundaries
- [ ] Tool execution timeouts and cancellation work identically for MCP tools
- [ ] Error handling follows established patterns and taxonomies

### Connection Loss Handling

- [ ] Connection loss detection triggers configured failure strategy
- [ ] Immediate unregistration removes tools cleanly from all system components
- [ ] Mark unhealthy strategy provides informative error responses
- [ ] Reconnection restores tool availability and updates health status
- [ ] Multiple connection failures handled gracefully without system impact

## Implementation Guidance

### Technical Approach

- Extend existing classes rather than creating parallel tool systems
- Use event-driven pattern for tool health status updates
- Implement proper synchronization for concurrent tool operations
- Follow established dependency injection patterns for testability

### Architecture Alignment

- Maintain existing tool system interfaces and contracts
- Use established validation patterns for new tool registration
- Follow current error handling and logging approaches
- Preserve existing tool execution performance characteristics

### Integration Strategy

- Hook into existing `BridgeClient` initialization sequence
- Leverage current tool registry and router infrastructure
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing tool configurations
- Use established configuration validation patterns

## Testing Requirements

### Dynamic Registration Testing

- Tool addition and removal operations under concurrent access
- Tool health status transitions and query accuracy
- Tool discovery integration with client initialization
- Error handling for malformed tool definitions from MCP servers

### Tool Execution Testing

- MCP tool execution follows same patterns as built-in tools
- Tool failure strategy behavior verification
- Health status impact on tool execution results
- Connection loss and recovery impact on tool availability

### End-to-End Validation with Mocks

- Complete tool discovery and execution flow using mock MCP servers
- Client initialization with mock MCP tool discovery
- Tool system cleanup on client disposal with mock connections
- Multiple mock MCP server tool registration scenarios

### Failure Scenario Testing

- MCP server unavailable during client initialization (using mocks)
- Tool execution during server connection loss (simulated)
- Recovery behavior after server reconnection (mock server restart)
- Invalid tool definitions from mock MCP servers

## Security Considerations

### Tool Validation Security

- Apply existing tool definition validation to MCP tools
- Validate tool schemas received from MCP servers
- Prevent execution of malformed or malicious tool definitions
- Maintain execution context security for MCP tools

### Registration Security

- Validate tool names to prevent conflicts or injection
- Ensure tool removal properly cleans up all references
- Prevent unauthorized tool registration through MCP channels
- Apply rate limiting to tool registration operations

### Execution Security

- MCP tools execute with same security constraints as built-in tools
- Tool health status cannot be manipulated by tool execution
- Error messages do not leak sensitive connection information
- Tool execution isolation maintained for MCP tools

## Performance Expectations

### Registration Performance

- Tool discovery and registration should complete within client initialization timeout
- Dynamic tool operations should not block other tool executions
- Tool health monitoring should have minimal performance overhead
- Registry operations should scale linearly with number of registered tools

### Execution Performance

- MCP tool execution performance should be comparable to built-in tools
- Tool health checks should add less than 5ms overhead to execution
- Unhealthy tool error responses should return immediately
- Connection health monitoring should not impact tool execution speed

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: F-mcp-protocol-core-implementation (MCP client required for tool discovery)
- **Builds Upon**: Existing tool system, configuration validation, client lifecycle
- **Integration Points**: Tool registry, tool router, bridge client initialization
- **Required By**: This is the final core feature (testing feature follows)

## Error Handling Strategy

### Tool Discovery Errors

- Server connection failures during discovery logged but do not fail initialization
- Invalid tool definitions from servers are rejected with clear logging
- Partial discovery failures allow successful tools to be registered
- Discovery timeout handling prevents indefinite initialization blocking

### Runtime Error Handling

- Tool unavailability returns standardized error responses
- Connection loss errors integrate with existing error taxonomy
- Tool health changes trigger appropriate logging and monitoring events
- Tool execution errors maintain existing error handling patterns
