# Add comprehensive cancellation testing suite

## Context

Create integration tests that validate end-to-end cancellation scenarios across the entire agent execution pipeline, from external signal input to complete cleanup.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Integration Test Suite

Create `src/core/agent/cancellation/__tests__/cancellationIntegration.test.ts`:

- End-to-end cancellation flow from BridgeClient through AgentLoop
- Multi-turn conversation cancellation scenarios
- Streaming cancellation with tool execution
- Resource cleanup validation
- Performance and timing requirements

### 2. Mock Cancellation Scenarios

Test realistic cancellation scenarios:

- User hits escape during agent thinking
- Cancellation during tool execution (single and multiple)
- Cancellation during streaming response
- Cancellation during context management operations
- Pre-cancelled signals (already aborted when passed)

### 3. Timing and Performance Tests

Validate cancellation performance requirements:

- Cancellation detection within 100ms
- Stream cancellation response within 200ms
- Tool execution cancellation within 500ms (graceful)
- Cleanup completion within 5000ms

### 4. Resource Leak Detection

- Memory usage monitoring during cancellation
- Network connection cleanup validation
- File handle cleanup verification
- Custom resource cleanup validation

### 5. Error Handling Validation

- Proper CancellationError creation and propagation
- Error context and metadata accuracy
- Cancellation reason preservation
- Cleanup status reporting in errors

## Acceptance Criteria

### Integration Test Coverage

- ✅ Complete cancellation flow from BridgeClient to AgentLoop
- ✅ Multi-turn conversation cancellation at different phases
- ✅ Streaming interruption cancellation scenarios
- ✅ Tool execution cancellation (sequential and parallel)
- ✅ Resource cleanup validation with mock resources

### Performance Test Requirements

- ✅ Cancellation detection latency validation (< 100ms)
- ✅ Stream cancellation response time validation (< 200ms)
- ✅ Tool cancellation timing validation (< 500ms graceful)
- ✅ Overall cleanup completion timing (< 5000ms)
- ✅ Normal execution performance impact measurement (< 5ms overhead)

### Error Handling Test Coverage

- ✅ CancellationError creation and inheritance validation
- ✅ Error context accuracy (phase, cleanup status, reason)
- ✅ Error propagation through execution layers
- ✅ Cancellation reason preservation from external sources

### Resource Management Test Coverage

- ✅ Memory cleanup validation with large conversation histories
- ✅ Network connection cleanup with streaming scenarios
- ✅ File handle cleanup with tool execution
- ✅ Custom cleanup handler execution validation
- ✅ Resource leak detection and prevention

### Contract Test Requirements

- ✅ Mock provider responses with cancellation scenarios
- ✅ Simulated tool execution with cancellation points
- ✅ State preservation validation through mocked scenarios
- ✅ Cleanup verification with test doubles

## File Structure

```
src/core/agent/cancellation/__tests__/
├── cancellationIntegration.test.ts
├── cancellationPerformance.test.ts
├── cancellationMocks.ts
└── fixtures/
    ├── mockCancellationScenarios.ts
    └── cancellationTestUtils.ts
```

## Dependencies

- Requires all cancellation infrastructure tasks to be completed
- Uses existing test utilities and mock frameworks

## Out of Scope

- Provider-specific cancellation testing (provider test responsibility)
- Application-level integration testing (consumer responsibility)
- Load testing or stress testing scenarios
