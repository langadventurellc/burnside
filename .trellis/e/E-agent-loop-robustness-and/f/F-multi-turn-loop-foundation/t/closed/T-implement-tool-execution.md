    Successfully implemented configurable tool execution strategies (sequential
    and parallel) with comprehensive error handling, result ordering, and
    performance characteristics. Created a pluggable strategy pattern that
    enables both sequential (default) and parallel tool execution within a
    single conversation turn. The implementation includes:


    **Core Strategy Interface**: Created ToolExecutionStrategy interface with
    separate files for ToolExecutionOptions and ToolExecutionResult to comply
    with linting rules.


    **Sequential Strategy**: Implements ordered execution with
    fail-fast/continue-on-error modes, maintaining predictable execution timing
    and resource usage with < 10ms overhead per tool call.


    **Parallel Strategy**: Implements concurrent execution with configurable
    concurrency limits, stable result ordering regardless of completion timing,
    and < 50ms coordination overhead. Includes semaphore-based concurrency
    limiting and comprehensive performance metrics.


    **ToolRouter Integration**: Extended ToolRouter with executeMultiple()
    method, strategy caching, and configuration validation. Maintains full
    backward compatibility with existing single-tool execution.


    **Comprehensive Testing**: Created extensive unit tests covering all
    strategies, error handling modes, performance characteristics, timeout
    enforcement, and integration scenarios. All 241 tests pass including new
    strategy tests.


    **Quality Assurance**: All code passes linting, formatting, and type
    checking with no warnings or errors. Follows project coding standards
    including one export per file and proper error handling patterns.

# Implement Tool Execution Strategies (Sequential and Parallel)

## Context

This task implements configurable tool execution strategies to support both sequential (default) and parallel tool execution within a single conversation turn. This enables efficient tool execution while maintaining result ordering and providing graceful handling of partial failures.

## Related Files

- New file: `src/core/agent/toolExecutionStrategy.ts` - Tool execution strategy implementations
- `src/core/agent/agentExecutionOptions.ts` - Extended options with strategy configuration

## Implementation Requirements

Create tool execution strategy implementations:

```typescript
interface ToolExecutionStrategy {
  execute(
    toolCalls: ToolCall[],
    router: ToolRouter,
    context: ToolExecutionContext,
    options: ToolExecutionOptions,
  ): Promise<ToolExecutionResult>;
}

class SequentialExecutionStrategy implements ToolExecutionStrategy {
  // Execute tools one after another in order
}

class ParallelExecutionStrategy implements ToolExecutionStrategy {
  // Execute tools concurrently with configurable max concurrency
}
```

## Technical Approach

1. **Define strategy interface** for pluggable tool execution patterns
2. **Implement sequential strategy** as safe default with ordered execution
3. **Implement parallel strategy** with configurable concurrency limits
4. **Maintain result ordering** regardless of execution completion order
5. **Handle partial failures** gracefully in both execution modes

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Sequential Execution Strategy**

- Executes tool calls one after another in original order
- Stops execution on first failure when configured (fail-fast mode)
- Continues execution on failures when `continueOnToolError` is enabled
- Maintains predictable execution timing and resource usage
- Provides detailed timing information for each tool execution

✅ **Parallel Execution Strategy**

- Executes multiple tool calls concurrently up to configured limit
- Maintains stable ordering of results in final conversation history
- Handles mixed success/failure scenarios with proper error aggregation
- Respects `maxConcurrentTools` configuration (default: 3)
- Provides concurrency metrics and execution timing data

✅ **Result Ordering**

- Tool results appear in conversation history in original call order
- Result ordering is stable regardless of execution completion timing
- Partial failures don't disrupt ordering of successful results
- Error results maintain proper position in conversation flow

✅ **Error Handling**

- Graceful handling of individual tool failures in both strategies
- Aggregated error reporting for parallel execution scenarios
- Timeout enforcement for individual tools and batch execution
- Comprehensive error context for debugging and monitoring

✅ **Performance Characteristics**

- Sequential strategy provides predictable resource usage
- Parallel strategy optimizes total execution time for independent tools
- Configurable concurrency prevents resource exhaustion
- Memory usage scales appropriately with tool count and concurrency

## Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests** (include in this task):

- Sequential execution with various tool counts and success/failure patterns
- Parallel execution with different concurrency levels and timing scenarios
- Result ordering validation for both strategies
- Error handling and aggregation in mixed success/failure scenarios
- Timeout enforcement and resource management
- Performance characteristics and timing accuracy

## Out of Scope

- Integration with streaming state machine (separate task)
- Provider-specific tool execution optimizations (future enhancement)
- Advanced scheduling algorithms (simple concurrency limits sufficient)
- Cross-turn tool execution dependencies (separate feature)

## Dependencies

- T-extend-agentexecutionoptions (for strategy configuration options)

## Security Considerations

- Validate concurrency limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- Ensure tool execution context isolation in parallel execution
- Prevent information leakage between concurrent tool executions
- Maintain existing tool security constraints in both strategies

## Performance Requirements

- Sequential execution overhead < 10ms per tool call
- Parallel execution coordination overhead < 50ms per batch
- Memory usage linear with concurrency level, not total tool count
- Timeout enforcement accurate within 100ms for individual tools

## Implementation Notes

- Use Promise.allSettled() for parallel execution to handle partial failures
- Implement result collection and ordering logic separate from execution
- Provide comprehensive metrics for performance monitoring and optimization
- Design for extensibility to support additional execution strategies
