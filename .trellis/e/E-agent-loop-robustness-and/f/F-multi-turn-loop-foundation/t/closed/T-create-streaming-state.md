# Create Streaming State Machine for Tool Call Interruption Handling

## Context

This task implements a streaming state machine that detects tool calls emitted during streaming responses and manages the pause/resume cycle. This is a core component for streaming interruption semantics in multi-turn conversations, handling the transition from streaming → tool execution → resume next turn.

## Related Files

- New file: `src/core/agent/streamingStateMachine.ts` - Core streaming state machine
- `src/core/agent/multiTurnState.ts` - MultiTurnState interface (defines streaming states)

## Implementation Requirements

Create a new `StreamingStateMachine` class with the following capabilities:

```typescript
class StreamingStateMachine {
  // Main orchestration methods
  async handleStreamingResponse(
    stream: AsyncIterable<ResponseChunk>,
  ): Promise<StreamingResult>;
  async pauseForToolExecution(detectedToolCalls: ToolCall[]): Promise<void>;
  async resumeAfterToolExecution(toolResults: ToolResult[]): Promise<void>;

  // State management
  getCurrentState(): StreamingState;
  validateStateTransition(from: StreamingState, to: StreamingState): boolean;

  // Tool call detection
  private detectToolCallsInChunk(chunk: ResponseChunk): ToolCall[];
  private accumulateStreamBuffer(chunk: ResponseChunk): void;
}
```

## Technical Approach

1. **Implement state machine pattern** with clear state transitions and validation
2. **Handle streaming data accumulation** with efficient buffering for partial responses
3. **Detect tool calls mid-stream** using provider-specific parsing logic
4. **Manage pause/resume semantics** for graceful stream interruption
5. **Provide error recovery** for streaming failures and partial responses

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

✅ **State Machine Implementation**

- Supports all streaming states: idle → streaming → paused → tool_execution → resuming
- Validates state transitions to prevent invalid state changes
- Provides clear state introspection for debugging and monitoring
- Handles concurrent state change requests gracefully

✅ **Tool Call Detection**

- Detects tool calls emitted during streaming responses
- Handles partial tool call data across multiple stream chunks
- Supports provider-specific tool call formats and structures
- Gracefully handles malformed or incomplete tool call data

✅ **Stream Management**

- Pauses streaming gracefully when tool calls are detected
- Accumulates streaming buffer during tool execution
- Resumes streaming seamlessly after tool completion
- Handles streaming errors and connection failures

✅ **Buffer Management**

- Efficiently buffers partial streaming responses during interruption
- Maintains buffer integrity across pause/resume cycles
- Provides memory-efficient handling of large streaming responses
- Cleans up buffers properly on completion or error

✅ **Integration Points**

- Integrates with MultiTurnState streaming state tracking
- Provides callbacks for tool execution coordination
- Supports different streaming response formats from various providers
- Maintains compatibility with non-streaming execution modes

## Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests** (include in this task):

- State machine transitions for all valid state combinations
- Tool call detection with various streaming chunk patterns
- Stream pause and resumption mechanics with buffer integrity
- Error handling during streaming interruption scenarios
- Buffer management with large and fragmented responses
- State validation and error recovery scenarios

## Out of Scope

- Integration with specific provider streaming APIs (separate task)
- Tool execution coordination (handled by multi-turn orchestrator)
- Parallel tool execution during streaming (separate task)
- Observability and event emission (separate task)

## Dependencies

- T-create-multiturnstate (for StreamingState definition)

## Security Considerations

- Validate stream data to prevent injection attacks
- Ensure buffer memory usage is bounded to prevent DoS
- Clean up sensitive data from buffers on completion/error
- Prevent state manipulation through malicious stream data

## Performance Requirements

- Tool call detection latency < 100ms for typical streaming chunks
- Buffer management overhead < 10% of streaming data size
- State transitions complete in < 10ms under normal conditions
- Memory usage bounded and predictable during long streams

## Implementation Notes

- Use efficient parsing for tool call detection without full JSON parsing
- Implement defensive programming for malformed streaming data
- Provide comprehensive error context for debugging stream issues
- Design for extensibility to support new provider streaming formats
