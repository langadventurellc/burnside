    system with rich debugging context, recovery strategies, and error
    serialization for observability systems. Created 4 specific error classes
    (MultiTurnExecutionError, MaxIterationsExceededError, IterationTimeoutError,
    MultiTurnStreamingInterruptionError) with comprehensive context including
    MultiTurnState snapshots, execution metrics, timing information, and debug
    context. Enhanced AgentLoop.executeMultiTurn() method with proper error
    handling that throws specific error types with context instead of generic
    errors. Fixed iteration limit logic bug where max iterations check was
    unreachable. All error types include error serialization with sensitive data
    redaction, recovery action suggestions, and proper error inheritance chains.
    Added comprehensive unit tests (21 test cases) and integration tests (6 test
    cases) covering error creation, inheritance, serialization, integration
    scenarios, and real error conditions. All quality checks passing with proper
    TypeScript typing and no lint issues. All 35 AgentLoop tests passing
    including the new error handling integration tests.

# Create Comprehensive Multi-Turn Error Types and Handling

## Context

This task implements new error types specific to multi-turn conversation scenarios and enhances error handling throughout the multi-turn system. These errors provide clear context for debugging multi-turn issues and enable proper error recovery strategies.

## Related Files

- New file: `src/core/agent/multiTurnErrors.ts` - Multi-turn specific error types
- `src/core/agent/agentLoop.ts` - Enhanced error handling in multi-turn methods

## Implementation Requirements

Create comprehensive error types for multi-turn scenarios:

```typescript
export class MaxIterationsExceededError extends Error {
  constructor(
    currentIteration: number,
    maxIterations: number,
    context?: MultiTurnContext,
  );
}

export class IterationTimeoutError extends Error {
  constructor(iteration: number, timeoutMs: number, context?: MultiTurnContext);
}

export class StreamingInterruptionError extends Error {
  constructor(
    streamingState: StreamingState,
    cause?: Error,
    context?: MultiTurnContext,
  );
}

export class MultiTurnExecutionError extends Error {
  constructor(
    phase: ExecutionPhase,
    originalError: Error,
    context?: MultiTurnContext,
  );
}
```

## Technical Approach

1. **Define error hierarchy** extending base Error with multi-turn context
2. **Include comprehensive context** for debugging and error analysis
3. **Implement error recovery strategies** for different error scenarios
4. **Enhance existing error handling** in AgentLoop with new error types
5. **Provide error serialization** for logging and observability

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Error Type Definitions**

- `MaxIterationsExceededError` includes iteration context and limits
- `IterationTimeoutError` provides timing information and iteration details
- `StreamingInterruptionError` includes streaming state and causation chain
- `MultiTurnExecutionError` wraps other errors with execution phase context
- All errors extend base Error class with proper inheritance

✅ **Error Context**

- Each error includes relevant MultiTurnState snapshot
- Execution timing and performance context included where relevant
- Tool execution context preserved for tool-related errors
- Conversation history size and iteration details included

✅ **Error Recovery**

- Enhanced error handling in `executeMultiTurn()` method
- Graceful degradation strategies for recoverable errors
- Proper cleanup of resources on unrecoverable errors
- Clear error propagation with preserved context

✅ **Integration with Existing Code**

- Extends existing error handling patterns in AgentLoop
- Maintains compatibility with current error handling code
- Provides migration path for existing error scenarios
- Integrates with IterationManager timeout detection

✅ **Debugging Support**

- Comprehensive error messages with actionable information
- Structured error data for programmatic analysis
- Error serialization for logging and monitoring systems
- Stack trace preservation with clear error boundaries

## Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests** (include in this task):

- Error creation with various context scenarios
- Error inheritance and instanceof behavior
- Error serialization and deserialization accuracy
- Integration with existing error handling patterns
- Error recovery scenarios in multi-turn execution
- Error context preservation through call stacks

## Out of Scope

- Logging and observability integration (separate task)
- Provider-specific error handling (separate feature)
- Advanced error recovery strategies (future enhancement)
- Error notification and alerting (separate concern)

## Dependencies

- T-create-multiturnstate (for MultiTurnState context)
- T-create-iteration-manager-for (for timeout error integration)

## Security Considerations

- Ensure error messages don't leak sensitive conversation data
- Redact tool parameters and API keys from error context
- Prevent error injection through malformed input
- Maintain security boundaries in error propagation

## Performance Requirements

- Error object creation overhead < 5ms under normal conditions
- Error context serialization efficient for logging
- Memory usage of error objects bounded and reasonable
- Error handling doesn't significantly impact normal execution performance

## Implementation Notes

- Use Error.cause for proper error chaining where available
- Implement proper stack trace preservation across async boundaries
- Design error hierarchy for future extensibility
- Provide both human-readable and machine-readable error information
