## Reason for Cancellation

After researching Anthropic's actual prompt caching implementation, this task is unnecessary and over-engineered.

**Anthropic's Reality:**

- Prompt caching is server-side only
- Clients only need to add `anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31` header
- Clients mark cache points with `"cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}` JSON field
- No client-side cache management, TTL, cleanup, or statistics needed

**What Was Planned vs What's Needed:**

- ❌ Complex cache management system with TTL and cleanup
- ❌ Cache key generation and hashing
- ❌ Session-based cache storage
- ❌ Cache policy management
- ✅ Simple helper to add cache headers and JSON fields

**Impact:**
This cancellation simplifies the implementation significantly while maintaining all actual functionality needed for Anthropic's prompt caching.
