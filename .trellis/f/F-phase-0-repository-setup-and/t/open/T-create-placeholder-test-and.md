# Create Placeholder Test and Verify Quality Gates

Create a trivial placeholder test to validate Jest setup and ensure all Phase 0 quality gates pass as specified in the acceptance criteria.

## Context

This final Phase 0 task validates that the scaffolding is complete and meets all quality requirements. The trivial test ensures Jest setup works correctly, and quality gate verification confirms the Phase 0 acceptance criteria are met.

Reference: Feature F-phase-0-repository-setup-and - Phase 0: Repository Setup and Scaffolding
Depends on: All previous Phase 0 tasks

## Specific Implementation Requirements

### 1. Trivial Placeholder Test (`src/index.test.ts`)

Create a basic test file that:

- Imports the main index.ts file successfully
- Verifies basic module structure exists
- Serves as Jest setup validation
- Tests basic import/export functionality

### 2. Quality Gate Verification

Ensure all Phase 0 acceptance criteria are met:

- `npm run quality` passes with zero errors
- `npm test` runs successfully with placeholder test
- All modules can be imported without errors
- TypeScript compilation succeeds

### 3. Module Export Validation

Verify that all scaffolded modules export correctly:

- Main src/index.ts exports key types and interfaces
- All core module index.ts files export their contents
- No broken import/export chains
- Clean module dependency structure

## Technical Approach

1. **Minimal Test**: Create the simplest possible test that validates setup
2. **Import Testing**: Verify all modules can be imported successfully
3. **Quality Commands**: Run and verify all quality gate commands pass
4. **Export Validation**: Test that module exports work as expected
5. **Documentation**: Update any necessary documentation for Phase 0 completion

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 0 Quality Gates (Must Pass)

- [ ] `npm run quality` passes with zero linting, formatting, or type errors
- [ ] `npm test` runs successfully with trivial placeholder test passing
- [ ] All scaffolded modules can be imported without compilation errors
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compilation succeeds for entire codebase

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Trivial placeholder test file created and passes
- [ ] Test verifies basic module loading functionality
- [ ] Jest setup is validated and working correctly
- [ ] All module imports resolve successfully in test environment

### Code Quality Requirements

- [ ] No linting errors in any scaffolded files
- [ ] All files properly formatted according to project standards
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors or warnings
- [ ] Consistent code organization across all modules

### Integration Requirements

- [ ] Main src/index.ts properly exports core types and interfaces
- [ ] All core module index.ts files have proper exports
- [ ] No circular dependencies between any modules
- [ ] Clean module structure ready for Phase 1 development

### Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Basic README updates if needed for Phase 0 completion
- [ ] TSDoc comments properly formatted and linting clean
- [ ] No broken documentation links or references

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive information in test files
- Test setup doesn't expose internal implementation details
- Placeholder test follows security best practices

## Testing Requirements (included in this task)

Create the placeholder test file:

- `src/index.test.ts` - Trivial test for Jest setup validation

The test should:

- Import main index.ts successfully
- Verify basic module structure
- Test that key exports are available
- Provide clear passing/failing feedback

Example test structure:

```typescript
// src/index.test.ts
describe("LLM Bridge Library", () => {
  it("should load main module successfully", () => {
    expect(() => require("./index")).not.toThrow();
  });

  it("should have basic module structure", () => {
    const bridge = require("./index");
    expect(bridge).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

## Out of Scope

- Comprehensive testing (saved for implementation phases)
- Performance testing or benchmarking
- Complex integration testing
- Provider-specific testing

## Dependencies

- Requires ALL previous Phase 0 tasks to be completed
- Uses all scaffolded modules and interfaces
- Validates the entire Phase 0 implementation

## Implementation Notes

1. Keep the test as simple as possible while validating setup
2. Focus on ensuring quality gates pass rather than comprehensive testing
3. Verify that the foundation is ready for Phase 1 development
4. Document any issues found during quality gate verification
5. Prepare the codebase for the next development phase

## Quality Gate Checklist

Before marking this task complete, verify:

- [ ] `npm run lint` passes with zero errors
- [ ] `npm run format` passes with zero changes needed
- [ ] `npm run type-check` passes with zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] `npm test` passes with the placeholder test
- [ ] All modules import successfully
- [ ] No compilation warnings or errors
- [ ] Clean git status (all files properly formatted and linted)

## Success Criteria

This task is complete when:

1. Trivial placeholder test exists and passes
2. All quality gate commands (`npm run quality`, `npm test`) pass
3. Phase 0 scaffolding is validated as ready for Phase 1
4. No linting, formatting, or compilation errors exist
5. Module structure supports future development phases
