# Integrate cancellation detection in AgentLoop multi-turn execution

## Context

Add cancellation detection points throughout the AgentLoop multi-turn execution to enable responsive interruption of agent conversations. This implements the core cancellation logic within the agent execution flow.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. AgentLoop Constructor Enhancement

Update `src/core/agent/agentLoop.ts` constructor to accept cancellation options:

- Initialize CancellationManager from AgentExecutionOptions.signal
- Set up cancellation context for execution methods
- Configure periodic cancellation checks based on options

### 2. Cancellation Detection Points

Add cancellation checks at strategic execution points:

```typescript
// Before each multi-turn iteration
private checkCancellationBeforeIteration(iteration: number): void

// Before tool call execution
private checkCancellationBeforeToolCall(toolCall: ToolCall): void

// During streaming response processing (periodic)
private scheduleStreamingCancellationChecks(): void

// During context management operations
private checkCancellationDuringContextOps(): void
```

### 3. executeMultiTurn Method Integration

Update executeMultiTurn method to:

- Check cancellation before each iteration
- Pass cancellation context to tool execution
- Handle cancellation during streaming scenarios
- Execute cleanup handlers when cancellation detected

### 4. Graceful Cancellation Process

Implement graceful cancellation workflow:

- Immediate cancellation detection and acknowledgment
- Allow current atomic operation to complete when possible
- Execute resource cleanup within timeout limits
- Preserve partial conversation state for debugging

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ AgentLoop accepts cancellation options in constructor
- ✅ Cancellation checks occur before each multi-turn iteration
- ✅ Cancellation checks occur before each tool call execution
- ✅ Periodic cancellation checks during streaming (every 100ms)
- ✅ Cancellation detection during context management operations

### Graceful Cancellation Requirements

- ✅ Immediate cancellation acknowledgment (< 50ms response time)
- ✅ Current atomic operation completion when possible
- ✅ Resource cleanup execution within graceful timeout (default 5000ms)
- ✅ Conversation state preservation up to cancellation point
- ✅ Partial execution results saved for debugging

### Error Handling Requirements

- ✅ CancellationError thrown with execution phase context
- ✅ Cleanup completion status included in error metadata
- ✅ Original cancellation reason preserved through error chain
- ✅ Proper error propagation to BridgeClient layer

### Performance Requirements

- ✅ Cancellation detection latency < 100ms during active execution
- ✅ Cancellation checking overhead < 5ms per check
- ✅ No measurable impact on normal execution performance
- ✅ Memory cleanup efficiency for cancelled conversations

### Testing Requirements

- ✅ Unit tests for cancellation detection at each check point
- ✅ Integration tests for multi-turn cancellation scenarios
- ✅ Performance tests for cancellation detection latency
- ✅ Resource cleanup validation tests
- ✅ Partial state preservation tests during cancellation

## Dependencies

- Requires BridgeClient cancellation support (T-enhance-bridgeclient-with)
- Integrates with existing multi-turn execution infrastructure

## Out of Scope

- Tool execution cancellation handling (separate task)
- Stream-specific cancellation logic (separate task)
- Provider-specific cancellation integration (separate task)
