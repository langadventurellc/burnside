# Rate Limiting E2E Tests for All Providers

## Purpose

Implement end-to-end tests that validate rate limiting functionality works correctly across all supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI) without measuring performance metrics.

## Key Components to Implement

### Core Test Infrastructure

- Shared rate limiting test utilities and helpers
- Provider-agnostic rate limiting validation functions
- Test client creation with rate limiting configurations
- Request timing and throttling validation logic

### Provider-Specific Test Suites

- OpenAI rate limiting E2E tests
- Anthropic rate limiting E2E tests
- Google rate limiting E2E tests
- xAI rate limiting E2E tests

### Test Scenarios

- Basic rate limiting enforcement (requests properly throttled)
- Scope-based rate limiting validation (global, provider, provider:model)
- Configuration validation (enabled/disabled states)
- Multiple concurrent request handling

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Behavior

- **Rate Limiting Enforcement**: Tests must verify that when rate limits are configured (e.g., 2 RPS), rapid consecutive requests are properly throttled and don't exceed the limit
- **Provider Independence**: Each provider test suite validates rate limiting works correctly with that provider's specific API endpoints and response patterns
- **Configuration Validation**: Tests verify rate limiting can be enabled/disabled via configuration and behaves correctly in both states
- **Scope Testing**: Tests validate different scope levels (global, provider, provider:model) create independent rate limiting buckets

### Test Implementation Requirements

- **Request Timing Validation**: Measure time between requests to verify throttling occurs (without performance benchmarking)
- **No Provider 429 Errors**: Validate that local rate limiting prevents overwhelming providers (no 429 responses due to rapid requests)
- **Configuration Integration**: Test rate limiting through BridgeClient configuration, not direct transport usage
- **Error Handling**: Verify graceful handling when rate limits are exceeded

### Test Structure Requirements

- **Shared Utilities**: Common helper functions for rate limiting test setup and validation
- **Provider Isolation**: Each provider test suite runs independently without affecting others
- **Environment Integration**: Tests use existing E2E test infrastructure (API keys, setup, teardown)
- **Timeout Handling**: Appropriate test timeouts that account for rate limiting delays

### Integration Points

- **Existing E2E Infrastructure**: Leverage current provider test setup, API key validation, and environment configuration
- **Enhanced Transport**: Tests validate rate limiting through EnhancedHttpTransport integration in BridgeClient
- **Configuration Schema**: Use validated BridgeConfig with rateLimitPolicy for test client creation

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Approach

- Extend existing E2E test structure in `src/__tests__/e2e/`
- Create shared rate limiting helpers in `src/__tests__/e2e/shared/`
- Add provider-specific rate limiting tests alongside existing chat/streaming tests
- Use controlled rate limits (e.g., 2-3 RPS) for predictable test behavior

### Test File Structure

```
src/__tests__/e2e/shared/rateLimitingHelpers.ts - Shared utilities
src/__tests__/e2e/openai/rateLimiting.e2e.test.ts - OpenAI tests
src/__tests__/e2e/anthropic/rateLimiting.e2e.test.ts - Anthropic tests
src/__tests__/e2e/google/rateLimiting.e2e.test.ts - Google tests
src/__tests__/e2e/xai/rateLimiting.e2e.test.ts - xAI tests
```

### Configuration Patterns

- Test clients with `rateLimitPolicy: { enabled: true, maxRps: 2, scope: "provider" }`
- Validation of disabled rate limiting behavior
- Multiple scope level testing (global, provider, provider:model)

## Dependencies

- Existing E2E test infrastructure and provider setup
- Enhanced HTTP transport implementation (already completed)
- Rate limiting system implementation (already completed)

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Strategy

1. **Simple Validation Focus**: Tests should verify rate limiting works, not measure performance
2. **Request Pattern Testing**: Send 5-6 rapid requests and verify they're spaced appropriately
3. **Provider API Integration**: Use real provider endpoints with minimal requests to validate integration
4. **Timing Tolerance**: Allow reasonable timing tolerance (Â±200ms) to account for network variability

### Key Test Scenarios per Provider

- **Basic Throttling**: Configure 2 RPS, send 4 requests rapidly, verify 2+ second total duration
- **Disabled State**: Configure rate limiting disabled, verify requests proceed without throttling
- **Provider Scope**: Verify different providers have independent rate limiting buckets
- **Model Scope**: Verify different models within same provider have independent buckets (when scoped)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Test Coverage

- Shared utility functions for rate limiting validation
- Test helper functions for client creation and timing measurement
- Provider-specific test configuration validation

### E2E Test Scenarios

- Rate limiting enforcement across all 4 providers
- Configuration validation (enabled/disabled states)
- Scope isolation testing (global vs provider vs model scopes)
- Integration with existing BridgeClient configuration patterns

### Validation Criteria

- Tests pass consistently with existing E2E test infrastructure
- Rate limiting prevents provider-side 429 errors
- Request timing validates throttling behavior without performance measurement
- All providers support rate limiting configuration through BridgeConfig

## Security Considerations

- Use existing E2E test API key management and validation
- Minimize API calls to reduce costs and avoid overwhelming providers
- Ensure test isolation doesn't affect other concurrent tests

## Performance Requirements

- Test execution time should be reasonable (under 30 seconds per provider)
- Minimal API usage - use smallest possible requests for validation
- No performance benchmarking or detailed timing analysis required
- Focus on functional validation only
