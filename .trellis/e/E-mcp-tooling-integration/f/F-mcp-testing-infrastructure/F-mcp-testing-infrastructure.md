# MCP Testing Infrastructure

## Purpose and Functionality

Create comprehensive testing infrastructure for MCP functionality including mock MCP servers, round-trip validation, and error scenario testing. This feature ensures all MCP components work correctly together and provides the foundation for ongoing MCP development and maintenance using unit tests and mocked components only.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Mock MCP Server Implementation

- Complete mock MCP server for testing protocol interactions
- Configurable tool definitions and server behaviors
- Support for connection lifecycle testing (connect, negotiate, disconnect)
- Simulation of various error conditions and edge cases

### 2. Round-Trip Validation Testing

- End-to-end testing of tool discovery, registration, and execution flow using mocks
- Validation of schema translation accuracy between MCP and unified formats
- Testing of all configuration scenarios and platform constraints
- Verification of error handling and recovery mechanisms

### 3. Configuration Validation Testing

- Comprehensive testing of all new configuration schema additions
- Platform constraint validation for React Native remote-only requirements
- Error message accuracy and clarity verification
- Backward compatibility validation with existing configurations

### 4. Error Scenario Testing

- Connection failure simulation and recovery testing using mocks
- Invalid response handling and error propagation
- Tool unavailability and health status transition testing
- Network timeout and cancellation scenario validation

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Mock MCP Server Implementation

## Implementation Guidance

### Technical Approach

- Create reusable mock server utilities for consistent testing
- Use existing testing patterns and frameworks from the codebase
- Implement test helpers for common MCP testing scenarios
- Design tests for easy maintenance and extension

### Test Organization

- Group tests by functionality (protocol, configuration, mock validation)
- Create shared test utilities for mock server management
- Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate test purpose
- Implement proper test isolation and cleanup

### Mock Server Design

- Design mock server to be configurable for different test scenarios
- Support both success and failure response patterns
- Enable simulation of various timing and network conditions
- Provide clear APIs for test scenario configuration

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Test Scenarios

- Complete MCP integration flow from configuration to tool execution using mocks
- Cross-platform compatibility verification with mock servers
- Error recovery and reconnection testing with mock server restarts
- Tool health status transition verification using mock connection events

### Edge Case Testing

- Malformed MCP server responses from mock servers
- Partial connection failures during tool discovery using mock timeouts
- Tool schema translation with complex parameter types from mock definitions
- Configuration validation with boundary conditions

### Performance Expectations

- Tool discovery should complete in reasonable time with mock servers
- Mock server interactions should not add significant test execution overhead
- Unit tests should complete within reasonable time limits
- Memory usage should remain stable during mock server testing

## Security Considerations

### Test Security

- Mock server does not expose real security vulnerabilities
- Test configurations do not use production credentials
- Network isolation ensured for test scenarios
- Proper cleanup prevents test data leakage

### Validation Testing

- Input validation testing covers injection attack scenarios with mock payloads
- Configuration validation prevents malicious configurations
- Tool schema validation prevents malformed tool execution using mock definitions
- Connection validation prevents unauthorized access patterns with mock servers
