# Agent Loop Robustness and Safety Epic

## Overview

Transform the existing single-turn agent loop into a robust multi-turn system with comprehensive safety controls, cancellation mechanisms, and intelligent context management. This epic implements Phase 9 of the LLM Bridge Library implementation plan, building upon the solid foundation of single-turn tool execution to create a production-ready agent orchestration system.

## Goals and Objectives

- **Multi-Turn Conversation Management**: Enable agents to conduct extended conversations with multiple tool calls across multiple turns
- **Robust Safety Controls**: Implement comprehensive safeguards against runaway executions, infinite loops, and resource exhaustion
- **Intelligent Context Management**: Provide sophisticated strategies for managing conversation history within token budget constraints
- **Provider-Aware Termination**: Normalize termination detection across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and xAI providers
- **Advanced Cancellation**: Support graceful cancellation at any point during agent execution, including mid-stream scenarios
- **Comprehensive Observability**: Enable detailed monitoring and debugging of agent execution with secure, redacted telemetry

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Multi-Turn Orchestrator**: Central loop managing conversation flow across multiple iterations
2. **Provider-Aware Termination Detection**: Unified termination model normalizing provider-specific completion signals
3. **Parallel Tool Execution Engine**: Support for concurrent tool calls within a single turn
4. **Context Strategy Framework**: Pluggable strategies for conversation trimming and summarization
5. **Token Budget Accounting**: Comprehensive token tracking and budget enforcement
6. **Cancellation Infrastructure**: AbortSignal-based cancellation with streaming support
7. **Observability Framework**: Secure event emission for monitoring and debugging

### Provider Termination Detection Strategy

Based on research, implement unified termination detection that normalizes:

- **OpenAI/xAI**: `finish_reason` field (`stop` = natural completion, `length` = token limit)
- **Anthropic**: `stop_reason` field (`end_turn` = natural completion, `max_tokens` = budget exceeded)
- **Google Gemini**: `finishReason` field (`STOP` = natural completion, `MAX_TOKENS` = budget exceeded)

### Parallel Tool Call Strategy

Support both execution patterns:

- **Sequential Execution**: Execute tool calls one after another (default for safety)
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute multiple tool calls concurrently with configurable max concurrency and stable result ordering

### Streaming State Machine

Implement robust streaming interruption semantics:

```
streaming_response → tool_call_emitted → pause_stream → execute_tools → append_tool_results → resume_next_turn
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Multi-Turn Execution**
   - ✅ Agent can conduct conversations with 2+ iterations
   - ✅ Supports both streaming and non-streaming modes
   - ✅ Handles mixed content and tool calls across turns
   - ✅ Maintains conversation state throughout execution

2. **Safety Controls**
   - ✅ Configurable maximum iterations (default: 10)
   - ✅ Overall execution timeout enforcement
   - ✅ Token budget limits with graceful degradation
   - ✅ Protection against infinite loops and runaway executions

3. **Provider-Aware Termination**
   - ✅ Correctly detects completion for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and xAI
   - ✅ Handles both streaming and non-streaming termination signals
   - ✅ Normalizes provider-specific completion reasons to unified model

4. **Parallel Tool Execution**
   - ✅ Supports sequential tool execution (default)
   - ✅ Supports parallel tool execution with configurable concurrency
   - ✅ Maintains stable ordering of tool results in conversation history
   - ✅ Handles partial failures in parallel execution scenarios

5. **Context Management**
   - ✅ Preserves system messages, latest tool results, and instruction anchors
   - ✅ Implements "frozen heads/tails" trimming strategy
   - ✅ Supports optional conversation summarization
   - ✅ Provides token budget accounting with provider-reported usage when available

6. **Cancellation Support**
   - ✅ Graceful cancellation via AbortSignal at any execution point
   - ✅ Mid-stream cancellation with proper cleanup
   - ✅ Cancellation status propagation through observability callbacks

7. **Error Handling**
   - ✅ New error types: `MaxIterationsExceededError`, `BudgetExceededError`
   - ✅ Graceful error recovery with continuation options
   - ✅ Comprehensive error context and debugging information

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Multi-turn execution overhead < 50ms per iteration
   - Context trimming performance scales linearly with message count
   - Token counting accuracy within 5% of provider-reported values

2. **Security**
   - All observability data is redacted by default (API keys, sensitive tool args)
   - Secure cleanup of sensitive data on cancellation
   - No sensitive information in error messages or logs

3. **Reliability**
   - 99.9% successful completion rate for valid multi-turn scenarios
   - Graceful degradation when context strategies fail
   - No memory leaks during extended conversations

4. **Observability**
   - Comprehensive event emission for all execution phases
   - Secret-safe telemetry with configurable redaction rules
   - Performance metrics for optimization and debugging

## User Stories

### As a Developer

- I want to create agents that can conduct multi-turn conversations so that I can build sophisticated AI workflows
- I want configurable safety limits so that I can prevent runaway executions in production
- I want detailed observability so that I can debug and optimize agent performance
- I want graceful cancellation so that I can interrupt long-running agent tasks

### As a System Administrator

- I want token budget controls so that I can manage API costs and resource usage
- I want comprehensive error handling so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues
- I want secure telemetry so that I can monitor system health without exposing sensitive data

### As an End User

- I want responsive agent interactions so that I can get quick feedback during conversations
- I want reliable agent behavior so that conversations complete successfully or fail gracefully

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- Existing AgentLoop implementation (foundation)
- ToolRouter and tool execution infrastructure
- Provider plugin system with streaming support
- Transport layer with cancellation support

### External Dependencies

- Provider APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI)
- Token counting utilities (tiktoken for OpenAI, approximate counting for others)
- AbortSignal polyfill for Node.js environments

## Technical Considerations

### Token Counting Strategy

- **Prefer provider-reported usage** when available (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI)
- **Fallback to approximation** using lightweight tokenizers or character heuristics
- **Expose accuracy flag** in budget accounting to indicate approximation level

### Context Preservation Strategy

- **Always retain**: System messages, latest tool results, instruction anchors
- **Trim middle bands first**: Remove older conversation turns while preserving context anchors
- **Graceful degradation**: Fall back to simple truncation if advanced strategies fail

### Streaming Architecture

- **State machine approach**: Clear transitions between streaming, tool execution, and resumption
- **Buffering strategy**: Accumulate partial responses during tool execution
- **Error recovery**: Handle stream interruption and resumption gracefully

## Estimated Scale

This epic encompasses approximately 4-6 features:

1. **Multi-Turn Loop Foundation** (Sub-phase 9.1)
2. **Cancellation Infrastructure** (Sub-phase 9.2)
3. **Context Management** (Sub-phase 9.3)
4. **Observability and Safety** (Sub-phase 9.4)
5. **Provider-Aware Termination** (Cross-cutting)
6. **Parallel Tool Execution** (Enhancement)

Each feature represents 2-4 weeks of development work including implementation, testing, and documentation.

## Success Metrics

- **Functionality**: All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive test coverage
- **Performance**: Multi-turn execution meets performance benchmarks
- **Reliability**: Production deployment with < 0.1% error rate
