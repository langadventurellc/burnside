# Create Transport Interfaces and HTTP Contracts

Implement the basic transport layer interfaces for HTTP communication with fetch injection support as specified in Phase 0 requirements.

## Context

This task creates the foundational HTTP transport interfaces that will enable provider communication. The implementation focuses on defining clean contracts for HTTP operations with fetch injection, without implementing retry logic or caching (which belong to later phases).

Reference: Feature F-phase-0-repository-setup-and - Phase 0: Repository Setup and Scaffolding
Depends on: T-create-base-directory, T-implement-basic-error

## Specific Implementation Requirements

Create transport interfaces and types in `src/core/transport/`:

### 1. HTTP Request/Response Types (`src/core/transport/types.ts`)

- `ProviderHttpRequest` interface for outbound HTTP requests
- `ProviderHttpResponse` interface for HTTP responses
- HTTP method types and header definitions
- Request/response body type definitions

### 2. Transport Interface (`src/core/transport/interface.ts`)

- `Transport` interface with fetch() and stream() method signatures
- Method contracts for HTTP operations with AbortSignal support
- Streaming response handling interface definitions

### 3. Fetch Injection System (`src/core/transport/client.ts`)

- `HttpClient` interface for configurable HTTP client
- Fetch function injection patterns
- Basic request/response interceptor hooks (no implementation)

### 4. Streaming Types (`src/core/transport/streaming.ts`)

- Streaming response interface definitions
- Async iterable patterns for chunk handling
- Basic streaming contracts (no buffer management implementation)

## Technical Approach

1. **Interface-First Design**: Define all HTTP contracts as TypeScript interfaces
2. **Fetch Injection**: Create patterns for injecting custom fetch implementations
3. **Abort Signal Support**: Include cancellation support in all HTTP operations
4. **Streaming Contracts**: Define streaming interfaces without implementation
5. **Error Integration**: Use error types from the error taxonomy

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] ProviderHttpRequest interface supports all necessary HTTP request properties
- [ ] ProviderHttpResponse interface handles status codes, headers, and body
- [ ] Transport interface defines fetch() and stream() method contracts
- [ ] HTTP client supports fetch injection for platform flexibility
- [ ] All interfaces support AbortSignal for request cancellation
- [ ] Streaming interfaces defined for async response handling

### Code Quality Requirements

- [ ] All transport interfaces compile without TypeScript errors
- [ ] No `any` types used in transport definitions
- [ ] Consistent interface naming and patterns
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns between transport layers
- [ ] Clean abstractions that support multiple HTTP implementations

### Testing Requirements (included in this task)

- [ ] Unit tests for interface compatibility and type checking
- [ ] Mock implementations to verify interface contracts
- [ ] Fetch injection pattern tests
- [ ] AbortSignal integration tests
- [ ] Basic streaming interface tests

### Integration Requirements

- [ ] All transport interfaces exported from src/core/transport/index.ts
- [ ] Transport types integrate with error taxonomy
- [ ] No circular dependencies between transport modules

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Interface definitions have no runtime overhead
- [ ] Streaming contracts support efficient data handling
- [ ] HTTP request/response types minimize memory allocation

## Security Considerations

- Request/response interfaces support header sanitization
- No sensitive data in interface type definitions
- Transport contracts enable secure header handling
- Support for authentication header patterns

## Testing Requirements (included in this task)

Create transport interface tests in `src/core/transport/`:

- `types.test.ts` - Test HTTP request/response type definitions
- `interface.test.ts` - Test Transport interface contracts
- `client.test.ts` - Test fetch injection patterns
- `streaming.test.ts` - Test streaming interface definitions

Test coverage should include:

- Interface type compatibility
- Fetch injection pattern validation
- AbortSignal support verification
- Streaming contract compliance
- Error integration with transport types

## Out of Scope

- HTTP retry logic implementation (Phase 10+)
- Response caching mechanisms (Phase 10+)
- Comprehensive streaming buffer management (Phase 2+)
- Provider-specific HTTP adaptations (Phase 4+)
- Advanced interceptor implementations (Phase 2+)

## Dependencies

- Requires T-create-base-directory for module structure
- Requires T-implement-basic-error for error type integration
- Can be developed in parallel with T-define-core-type-interfaces

## Implementation Notes

1. Design interfaces to support both Node.js fetch and browser fetch
2. Include AbortSignal support for all async operations
3. Create clean separation between transport and provider concerns
4. Design streaming interfaces to support future buffer management
5. Maintain compatibility with standard HTTP patterns
6. Keep interfaces minimal and focused on contracts only

## Example Interface Structure

```typescript
// Example from src/core/transport/types.ts
export interface ProviderHttpRequest {
  url: string;
  method: "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE";
  headers?: Record<string, string>;
  body?: string | Uint8Array;
  signal?: AbortSignal;
}

export interface ProviderHttpResponse {
  status: number;
  statusText: string;
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  body: ReadableStream<Uint8Array> | null;
}

// Example from src/core/transport/interface.ts
export interface Transport {
  fetch(
    request: ProviderHttpRequest,
    signal?: AbortSignal,
  ): Promise<ProviderHttpResponse>;

  stream(
    request: ProviderHttpRequest,
    signal?: AbortSignal,
  ): Promise<AsyncIterable<Uint8Array>>;
}
```
