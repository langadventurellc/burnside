# Create Iteration Manager for Timeout and Limit Enforcement

## Context

This task implements an `IterationManager` class responsible for tracking iteration counts, enforcing timeout limits, and managing termination conditions. This component ensures multi-turn conversations respect configured limits and terminate gracefully when thresholds are exceeded.

## Related Files

- New file: `src/core/agent/iterationManager.ts` - Iteration management and enforcement
- `src/core/agent/multiTurnState.ts` - MultiTurnState interface for state tracking

## Implementation Requirements

Create an `IterationManager` class with comprehensive limit enforcement:

```typescript
class IterationManager {
  // Initialization and configuration
  constructor(options: AgentExecutionOptions, startTime: number);

  // Iteration tracking
  startIteration(): void;
  completeIteration(): IterationResult;
  getCurrentIteration(): number;

  // Limit enforcement
  canContinue(): boolean;
  checkTimeouts(): TimeoutStatus;
  enforceIterationLimit(): boolean;

  // Termination logic
  determineTerminationReason(): TerminationReason;
  getExecutionMetrics(): ExecutionMetrics;
}
```

## Technical Approach

1. **Implement iteration tracking** with precise timing and count management
2. **Enforce timeout limits** at iteration and overall conversation levels
3. **Provide termination detection** with clear reasoning for debugging
4. **Generate execution metrics** for performance monitoring and optimization
5. **Handle edge cases** like clock changes, long-running iterations, and cleanup

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Iteration Tracking**

- Tracks current iteration number (1-based counting)
- Records start and completion time for each iteration
- Maintains total iteration count against configured maximum
- Provides iteration duration and timing statistics

✅ **Timeout Enforcement**

- Enforces overall conversation timeout (`timeoutMs`)
- Enforces per-iteration timeout (`iterationTimeoutMs`)
- Provides early warning before timeout expiration
- Handles timeout edge cases gracefully (clock changes, etc.)

✅ **Limit Enforcement**

- Enforces maximum iteration limit (`maxIterations`, default: 10)
- Provides clear boolean indicators for continuation eligibility
- Prevents off-by-one errors in iteration counting
- Handles configuration edge cases (zero limits, negative values)

✅ **Termination Detection**

- Determines termination reason: natural_completion, max_iterations, timeout, error
- Provides clear termination context for debugging and observability
- Supports early termination scenarios with proper cleanup
- Maintains termination state consistency across concurrent operations

✅ **Execution Metrics**

- Tracks total execution time and iteration count
- Calculates average iteration time and performance statistics
- Provides timing breakdown for performance optimization
- Includes tool execution statistics integration

## Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests** (include in this task):

- Iteration counting accuracy with various conversation lengths
- Timeout enforcement at both iteration and overall levels
- Maximum iteration limit enforcement with boundary conditions
- Termination reason determination for all scenarios
- Execution metrics accuracy and timing calculations
- Edge cases: zero timeouts, negative limits, clock changes

## Out of Scope

- Tool execution timeout enforcement (handled by tool execution strategies)
- Streaming timeout management (handled by streaming state machine)
- Provider-specific timeout considerations (separate feature)
- Advanced scheduling and resource management (future enhancement)

## Dependencies

- T-create-multiturnstate (for TerminationReason and state definitions)
- T-extend-agentexecutionoptions (for timeout and limit configuration)

## Security Considerations

- Validate timeout and limit values to prevent resource exhaustion
- Ensure timeout enforcement can't be bypassed through manipulation
- Prevent integer overflow in iteration counting and timing calculations
- Clean up resources properly on forced termination

## Performance Requirements

- Iteration tracking overhead < 5ms per iteration
- Timeout checking overhead < 1ms per check
- Memory usage constant regardless of iteration count
- Timing accuracy within 10ms under normal system load

## Implementation Notes

- Use high-resolution timing for accurate iteration duration measurement
- Implement defensive programming for timeout and limit edge cases
- Provide comprehensive debugging information for termination scenarios
- Design for integration with existing AgentLoop error handling patterns
