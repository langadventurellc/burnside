# Integrate Streaming Interruption with Multi-Turn Orchestration

## Context

This task integrates the streaming state machine with the core multi-turn orchestration in AgentLoop, enabling seamless handling of tool calls that are emitted mid-stream during conversation turns. This implements the complete streaming interruption semantics: streaming → tool_call_detected → pause → execute_tools → resume_next_turn.

## Related Files

- `src/core/agent/agentLoop.ts` - Main AgentLoop class requiring integration
- `src/core/agent/streamingStateMachine.ts` - Streaming state machine (from previous task)
- `src/core/agent/toolExecutionStrategy.ts` - Tool execution strategies (from previous task)

## Implementation Requirements

Enhance the `AgentLoop.executeMultiTurn()` method to support streaming interruption:

```typescript
// Add new method to AgentLoop
private async handleStreamingTurn(
  messages: Message[],
  streamingStateMachine: StreamingStateMachine,
  options: AgentExecutionOptions
): Promise<StreamingTurnResult>;

// Enhance existing executeMultiTurn to use streaming when enabled
async executeMultiTurn(
  initialMessages: Message[],
  options?: AgentExecutionOptions
): Promise<MultiTurnResult>;
```

## Technical Approach

1. **Integrate streaming state machine** into multi-turn execution flow
2. **Coordinate tool execution** during streaming interruption scenarios
3. **Manage state transitions** between streaming and tool execution phases
4. **Handle resume logic** after tool execution completion
5. **Provide fallback support** for non-streaming execution modes

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Streaming Integration**

- Detects tool calls emitted during streaming responses accurately
- Pauses streaming gracefully when tool calls are detected
- Executes tools while maintaining streaming state context
- Resumes conversation flow seamlessly after tool execution
- Handles streaming errors and partial responses without data loss

✅ **State Coordination**

- Synchronizes MultiTurnState with StreamingStateMachine state
- Updates iteration state during streaming interruption cycles
- Maintains conversation history integrity across pause/resume cycles
- Provides consistent state visibility for debugging and monitoring

✅ **Tool Execution Integration**

- Applies configured tool execution strategy during interruption
- Handles both sequential and parallel tool execution in streaming context
- Maintains tool result ordering in conversation history
- Coordinates timeouts between streaming and tool execution phases

✅ **Error Handling**

- Gracefully handles streaming interruption failures
- Provides proper error recovery when streaming can't be resumed
- Maintains conversation state on streaming errors
- Falls back to non-streaming mode when streaming fails

✅ **Performance Optimization**

- Minimizes overhead during streaming interruption detection
- Efficient buffer management during pause/resume cycles
- Optimal coordination between streaming and tool execution timing
- Memory usage remains bounded during extended streaming conversations

## Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests** (include in this task):

- Streaming interruption detection with various tool call patterns
- Complete pause/resume cycles with tool execution integration
- State synchronization between streaming and multi-turn state management
- Error scenarios during streaming interruption and recovery
- Performance characteristics of streaming interruption overhead
- Fallback behavior when streaming is disabled or fails

## Out of Scope

- Provider-specific streaming API integration (separate task)
- Advanced streaming optimization (buffering strategies, etc.)
- Cancellation during streaming interruption (separate feature)
- Streaming observability events (separate task)

## Dependencies

- T-implement-core-multi-turn (core multi-turn orchestration)
- T-create-streaming-state (streaming state machine implementation)
- T-implement-tool-execution (tool execution strategies)

## Security Considerations

- Validate tool calls detected during streaming to prevent injection
- Ensure streaming buffer cleanup on errors or cancellation
- Prevent state corruption during concurrent streaming operations
- Maintain existing tool execution security constraints

## Performance Requirements

- Streaming interruption detection overhead < 100ms
- State synchronization overhead < 20ms per interruption
- Memory usage during pause/resume cycles bounded and predictable
- Tool execution coordination adds < 50ms latency

## Implementation Notes

- Design for clean separation between streaming and orchestration concerns
- Use async/await patterns for clear control flow during interruption
- Provide comprehensive error context for debugging streaming issues
- Ensure integration doesn't break existing non-streaming execution paths
