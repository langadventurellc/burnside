# Cancellation Infrastructure Feature

## Overview

Implement comprehensive cancellation support throughout the agent execution chain using AbortSignal-based mechanisms. This feature enables graceful interruption of agent execution at any point, including mid-stream scenarios, with proper cleanup and state preservation.

## Purpose and Functionality

Provide robust cancellation capabilities that allow:

- Immediate interruption of agent execution from external systems
- Graceful cleanup of resources and state during cancellation
- Mid-stream cancellation with proper stream handling
- Propagation of cancellation status through the execution chain
- Recovery and resume capabilities where appropriate

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Cancellation-Aware Execution Context

```typescript
interface CancellableExecutionContext {
  signal?: AbortSignal;
  onCancel?: (reason?: string) => void;
  checkCancellation(): void;
  throwIfCancelled(): void;
  isCancelled(): boolean;
  cancellationReason?: string;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Agent Execution Options

```typescript
interface AgentExecutionOptions {
  // ... existing options

  // Cancellation options
  signal?: AbortSignal;
  cancellationCheckIntervalMs?: number; // Default: 100ms
  gracefulCancellationTimeoutMs?: number; // Default: 5000ms
  forceCancellationAfterMs?: number; // Default: 10000ms
  cleanupOnCancel?: boolean; // Default: true
}
```

### 3. Cancellation Manager

```typescript
class CancellationManager {
  private abortController: AbortController;
  private checkInterval?: ReturnType<typeof setInterval>;
  private cleanupHandlers: Array<() => Promise<void>>;

  createCancellableContext(): CancellableExecutionContext;
  schedulePeriodicChecks(): void;
  cancel(reason?: string): void;
  addCleanupHandler(handler: () => Promise<void>): void;
  performCleanup(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 4. Stream Cancellation Handler

```typescript
interface StreamCancellationHandler {
  pauseStream(): Promise<void>;
  resumeStream(): Promise<void>;
  cancelStream(reason?: string): Promise<void>;
  getStreamState(): "active" | "paused" | "cancelled" | "completed";
}
```

### 5. Cancellation Error Types

```typescript
class CancellationError extends Error {
  readonly code = "CANCELLATION_ERROR";
  readonly reason?: string;
  readonly phase:
    | "initialization"
    | "execution"
    | "tool_calls"
    | "streaming"
    | "cleanup";
  readonly cleanupCompleted: boolean;
}

class GracefulCancellationTimeoutError extends CancellationError {
  readonly code = "GRACEFUL_CANCELLATION_TIMEOUT";
}
```

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Error Handling Requirements

1. **Cancellation Error Propagation**

   - ✅ Execution phase information in error details
   - ✅ Cleanup completion status in error metadata

2. **Timeout Handling**
   - ✅ Graceful cancellation timeout with forced termination

   - ✅ Tool execution graceful shutdown timeout
   - ✅ Stream termination timeout handling

3. **Partial State Recovery**
   - ✅ Preserve conversation state up to cancellation point

   - ✅ Maintain execution metadata for debugging
   - ✅ Enable resume from cancellation point (where applicable)

### Performance Requirements

1. **Cancellation Detection Latency**
   - Cancellation detection within 100ms in active execution
   - Stream cancellation response within 200ms
   - Tool execution cancellation within 500ms (graceful)
   - Immediate cancellation response < 50ms (forced)

2. **Cleanup Performance**
   - Resource cleanup completion within 5 seconds (graceful)
   - Forced cleanup completion within 10 seconds
   - Memory cleanup efficiency for large conversations
   - Network cleanup without connection leaks

3. **Impact on Normal Execution**
   - Cancellation checking overhead < 5ms per check
   - No measurable impact on streaming performance
   - Minimal memory overhead for cancellation infrastructure

## Implementation Guidance

### Technical Approach

1. **Composition Pattern**
   - Wrap existing execution methods with cancellation-aware versions
   - Use decorators or higher-order functions for cancellation injection
   - Maintain clean separation between core logic and cancellation concerns

2. **Signal Propagation Strategy**
   - Pass AbortSignal through all async operations
   - Create child signals for component-specific cancellation
   - Use AbortController composition for complex cancellation hierarchies

3. **Cleanup Handler Pattern**
   - Register cleanup handlers at resource allocation points
   - Execute cleanup handlers in reverse order (LIFO)
   - Handle cleanup failures gracefully without blocking cancellation

4. **State Preservation Strategy**
   - Snapshot state at cancellation checkpoints
   - Use immutable state patterns where possible
   - Provide state serialization for persistence across cancellation
