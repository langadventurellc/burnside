# Create resource cleanup management system

## Context

Implement comprehensive resource cleanup coordination to ensure proper cleanup of memory, network connections, file handles, and custom resources when cancellation occurs.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. CleanupManager Class

Create `src/core/agent/cancellation/cleanupManager.ts`:

```typescript
interface CleanupHandler {
  id: string;
  handler: () => Promise<void>;
  priority: "critical" | "normal" | "optional";
  timeoutMs?: number;
}

class CleanupManager {
  private handlers: Map<string, CleanupHandler> = new Map();
  private cleanupInProgress = false;

  // Handler registration
  register(handler: CleanupHandler): void;
  unregister(id: string): void;

  // Cleanup execution
  performCleanup(timeoutMs?: number): Promise<CleanupResult>;
  forceCleanup(): Promise<CleanupResult>;

  // Status monitoring
  isCleanupInProgress(): boolean;
  getRegisteredHandlers(): string[];
}
```

### 2. Resource Cleanup Categories

Support different cleanup priorities:

- **Critical**: Must complete (database transactions, locks)
- **Normal**: Should complete (file handles, network connections)
- **Optional**: Best effort (cache cleanup, temporary files)

### 3. Cleanup Execution Strategy

- Execute handlers in reverse registration order (LIFO) within each priority
- Run critical handlers first, then normal, then optional
- Continue execution even if individual handlers fail
- Enforce individual handler timeouts
- Log cleanup failures without throwing exceptions

### 4. Integration with CancellationManager

- Register cleanup manager with CancellationManager
- Automatic cleanup execution on cancellation
- Timeout coordination between cancellation and cleanup
- Status reporting for cleanup completion

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ CleanupManager supports handler registration with priorities
- ✅ Cleanup execution follows priority order (critical → normal → optional)
- ✅ LIFO execution order within each priority level
- ✅ Individual handler timeout enforcement
- ✅ Continued execution despite individual handler failures

### Resource Management Requirements

- ✅ Memory cleanup for large conversation histories
- ✅ Network connection cleanup for streaming
- ✅ File handle cleanup for temporary resources
- ✅ Custom cleanup handler support for application-specific resources

### Error Handling Requirements

- ✅ Individual cleanup handler failures logged but don't stop process
- ✅ Timeout handling for slow cleanup operations
- ✅ Overall cleanup timeout enforcement (default: 5000ms)
- ✅ Cleanup result reporting with success/failure details

### Integration Requirements

- ✅ Seamless integration with CancellationManager
- ✅ Automatic cleanup execution on cancellation detection
- ✅ Status reporting for observability and debugging
- ✅ No resource leaks when cleanup completes or times out

### Testing Requirements

- ✅ Unit tests for handler registration and priority ordering
- ✅ Cleanup execution order and timeout validation tests
- ✅ Error handling during cleanup execution tests
- ✅ Integration tests with CancellationManager
- ✅ Resource leak prevention validation tests
- ✅ Performance tests for cleanup execution timing

## File Structure

```
src/core/agent/cancellation/
├── cleanupManager.ts
└── __tests__/
    └── cleanupManager.test.ts
```

## Dependencies

- Requires CancellationManager implementation (T-implement-cancellationmanager)
- Works with all other cancellation infrastructure components

## Out of Scope

- Application-specific cleanup handler implementations
- Provider-specific resource cleanup (provider responsibility)
- Tool-specific cleanup handling (tool responsibility)
