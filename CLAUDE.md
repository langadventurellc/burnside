# Instructions for working in the LLM Bridge Library

A TypeScript library that acts as a unified bridge to multiple LLM provider APIs for use across Desktop (Electron), Mobile (React Native), and Web (Node.js) platforms. The library provides an extensible architecture for integrating various LLM providers and tools while maintaining a consistent interface across all platforms.

## Repository Structure

**Applications:**

- `src/data/defaultLlmModels.ts` - configured LLM providers, models and model capabilities. **ALL** provider and model information should come from this file and **NEVER EVER** hardcoded.

## Commands

### Testing & Quality

| Command            | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm test`         | Run unit tests with Jest                          |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run E2E tests with Jest                           |
| `npm run quality`  | Run all quality checks (lint, format, type-check) |

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (5.8+)
- **Unit Testing**: Jest (30.0+)

## Coding Standards

### Files / Packages

- ‚â§‚ÄØ400 logical‚ÄØLOC
- No ‚Äúutil‚Äù dumping grounds
- Naming:
  - `ComponentName.tsx` (PascalCase)
  - `moduleName.ts` / `moduleName.css` (camelCase)

###¬†Forbidden

- `any` types
- Dead code kept around
- Shared ‚Äúkitchen‚Äësink‚Äù modules
- Hard‚Äëcoded secrets or env values
- **NEVER** create integration or performance tests
- **NEVER** keep deprecated code for "backwards compatibility". Breaking old code is encouraged and preferred to keeping dead code for backwards compatibility. This is a greenfield project that's not being used anywhere, so there's no need for backwards compatibility.

## ü§î When You're Unsure

1. **Stop** and ask a clear, single question.
2. Offer options (A / B / C) if helpful.
3. Wait for user guidance before proceeding.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Ask Perplexity
- If you need clarification, ask specific questions with options
